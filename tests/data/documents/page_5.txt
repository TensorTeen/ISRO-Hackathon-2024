DESCRIPTION OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER CLASSES
LULC classification scheme and brief description of classes are as given hereunder:
Land Cover is defined as observed physical features on the Earth's Surface. When an economic
function is added to it, it becomes Land Use. (FAO, 2005).
1.0 BUILT-UP LAND
It is an area of human habitation developed due to non-agricultural use and that has a cover of
buildings, transport and communication, utilities in association with water, vegetation and vacant
lands. Web LULC map consists of 3 classes under built-up viz., urban, rural and mining.
1.1 Urban: Urban areas are non-linear built up areas covered by impervious structures
adjacent to or connected by streets. This cover is related to centers of population. This
class usually occurs in combination with, vegetated areas that are connected to buildings that
show a regular pattern, such as vegetated areas, gardens etc. and industrial and/or other areas.
(FAO, 2005).It includes residential areas, mixed built-up, recreational places, public / semi-public
utilities, communications, public utilizes/facility, commercial
areas, reclaimed
areas,
vegetated areas, transportation, industrial areas and their dumps, and ash/cooling ponds.
1.2 Rural: These are the lands used for human settlement of size comparatively less than the
urban settlements of which the majority of population is involved in the primary activity of
agriculture. These are the built-up areas, smaller in size, mainly associated with agriculture and
allied sectors and non-commercial activities. They can be seen in clusters non- contiguous or
scattered.
1.3 Mining: Mining areas encompass area under surface mining operations. The recognizable
impacts of these activities on the landscape are unmistakable giant pit mines covering vast
areas. The presence of water bodies does not necessarily imply inactive or unused extractive
areas; ponds or lakes are often an integral part of an extractive operation. (USGS, 1999) It includes
surface rocks and stone quarries, sand and gravel pits, brick kilns, etc. These are areas of stockpile
of storage dump of industrial raw material or slag/effluents or waste material or quarried/mixed
debris from earth's surface.
2.0 AGRICULTURAL LAND
These are the lands primarily used for farming and for production of food, fiber, and other
commercial and horticultural crops. It consists of:
2.1 Cropland: These are the areas with standing crop as on the date of Satellite
overpass. Cropped areas appear in bright red to red in color with varying shape and size in a
contiguous to non- contiguous pattern. They are widely distributed indifferent terrains;
prominently appear in the irrigated areas irrespective of the source of irrigation. It includes
kharif, rabi and zaid crop lands along with areas under double or triple crops.

casuarina, bamboo etc.
3.4. Scrub Forest: These are the forest areas which are generally seen at the fringes of dense
forest cover and settlements, where there is biotic and abiotic interference. Most times they are
located closer to habitations. Forest blanks which are the openings amidst forest areas, devoid
of tree cover, observed as openings of assorted size and shapes as manifested on the imagery
are also included in this category.
3.5 Littoral/Swamp/Mangrove Forest: These are tropical and subtropical vegetation species
that are densely colonized on coastal tidal flats, estuaries salt marshes etc. This category
includes all the areas where the canopy cover/density is above10%.
4.0 GRASS / GRAZING LAND
These are the areas of natural grass along with other vegetation, predominantly grass-like plants
(Monocots) and non-grass-like herbs (except Lantana species which are to be classified as scrub).
It includes natural/semi-natural grass/ grazing lands of Alpine/Sub-Alpine or temperate or sub-
tropical or tropical zones, desertic areas and manmade grasslands.
5.0 WASTELANDS
Described as degraded lands which can be brought under vegetative cover with reasonable effort
and which is currently underutilized and land which is deteriorating for lack of appropriate water
and soil management or on account of natural causes. It consists of:
5.1 Salt-Affected Land: Generally characterized as land that has excess salt in the soils with patchy
growth of grasses.
5.2 Gullied / Ravinous Land: They are the resultant of terrain deformation due to water erosion
which occurs widely in all agro-climatic zones. Gullies are formed as a result of localized surface
run-off affecting the unconsolidated material resulting in the formation of perceptible channels
causing undulating terrain. They are mostly associated with stream courses, sloping grounds with
good rainfall regions and foothill regions. These are the first stage of excessive land dissection
followed by their networking which leads to the development of ravinous land. Ravines are
basically extensive systems of gullies developed along river courses.
5.3 Scrub Land: These areas possess shallow and skeletal soils, at times chemically degraded
extremes of slopes, severely eroded or subjected to excessive aridity with scrubs dominating the
landscape.
5.4 Sandy Area: These can occur in coastal, Riverine or inland areas. Desertic sands are
characterized by accumulation of sand developed in situ or transported by Aeolian processes.
Coastal sands are the sands that are accumulated as a strip along the sea-coast. Riverine sands
are those that are seen as accumulations in the flood plain as sheets which are the resultant
phenomena
of
river
flooding.

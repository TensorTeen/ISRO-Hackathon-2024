2.2 Plantations: These are the areas under agricultural tree crops planted adopting agricultural
management techniques. Depending on the location, they are exhibit a dispersed or contiguous
pattern. Use of multi-season data will enable their separation in a better way. It includes
agricultural plantation (like tea, coffee, rubber etc.) horticultural plantation (like coconut, arecanut,
citrus fruits, orchards, fruits, ornamental shrubs and trees, vegetable gardens etc.) and agro-
horticultural plantation.
2.3 Fallow: An agricultural system with an alternation between a cropping period of several
years and a fallow period. (Ruthenberg, 1980). In another terms these are the lands, which are
taken up for cultivation but are temporarily allowed to rest, un-cropped for one or more
season, but not less than one year.
2.4 Current Shifting Cultivation areas: This describes the growing of crops for a few years on
selected and clear plots, alternating with a lengthy period of vegetative fallow when the soil is
rested. The land is cultivated for less than 33 percent of the time (Ruthenberg, 1980). This cover
is followed by the vegetative and / or bare cover of the fallow period that can last for several years
(Shaneret. Al., 1982). These are the areas which are clearly perceptible on the satellite image that
are in pre-burnt /post-burnt condition as bright white or with bluish small irregular patches amidst
forest patches that are red in colour.
3.0 FOREST
The term forest is used to refer to land with a tree canopy cover of more than 10 percent and
area of more than 0.5 ha. Forests are determined both by the presence of trees and the absence
of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 m (MOEF,
2011). It consists of:
3.1 Evergreen/Semi-Evergreen: This term as such describes the phenology of perennial plants
that are never entirely without green foliage (Ford-Robertson, 1971). This category comprises of
tall trees, which are predominantly remain green throughout the year. It includes both
coniferous and tropical broadleaved evergreen species. Semi- evergreen is a forest type that
includes a combination of evergreen and deciduous species with the former dominating the
canopy cover.
3.2 Deciduous: This applies to the phenology of perennial plants that are leafless for a certain
period of the year (Ford-Robertson, 1971). The leaf shedding usually takes place simultaneously
in connection with the unfavorable season (UNESCO, 1973).
These are the forest types that are predominantly composed of species, which shed their leaves
once a year, especially during summer. It also includes tree clad area with tree cover lying
outside the notified forest boundary areas that are herbaceous with a woody appearance (e.g.
bamboos, palms, tree ferns etc.).
3.3. Forest Plantation: These are the areas of tree species of forestry importance, raised and
managed especially in notified forest areas. The species mainly constitute teak, Sal, eucalyptus,

Ver.1
5.5. Barren Rocky/Stony Waste: These are rock exposures of varying lithology often barren and
devoid of soil and vegetation cover.
5.6 Rann Area: An extensive salt marsh of western India between the Gulf of Kutch and the
Indus River delta.
6.0 WETLAND / WATER BODIES
All submerged or water-saturated lands, natural or man-made, inland or coastal, permanent or
temporary, static or dynamic, vegetated or non-vegetated, which necessarily have a land-water
interface, are defined as wetlands. It consists of:
6.1 Inland Wetlands: These are the areas that include ox-bow lakes, cut-off meanders, playas,
marsh, etc. which are seasonal as well as permanent in nature. It also includes manmade
wetlands like waterlogged areas (seasonal and perennial).
6.2 Coastal Wetland: These include estuaries, lagoons, creek, backwater, bay, tidal flat/mud
flat, sand/beach, rocky coast, mangrove, salt marsh/marsh vegetation and other hydrophytic
vegetation and saltpans.
6.3 River /Stream / Canals: Rivers/streams are natural course of water flowing on the land surface
along a definite channel/slope regularly or intermittently towards a sea in most cases or in to a
lake or an inland basin in desert areas or a marsh or another river. Canals are artificial water course
constructed for irrigation, navigation or to drain out excess water from agricultural lands.
6.4 Water Bodies: This category comprises areas with surface water in the form of ponds, lakes,
tanks and reservoirs.
7.0 SNOW AND GLACIERS
These are the areas under snow cover confined to the Himalayan region. They are mostly
located in mountain peaks and steep slopes/high relief areas. These are the areas which remain
under snow either on temporary or permanent basis. These are the areas under perpetual
snow cover throughout the year. They are the origins of most of Himalayan river systems.
METHODOLOGY
On-screen visual interpretation was used in the current exercise wherein the GIS LULC vector layer
created during the first cycle was overlaid on to the terrain corrected Resourcesat 2 LISS III imagery
acquired during 2015-16. The methodology essentially is based on editing the above vector layer for
the changed areas thereby creating the new LULC vector layer
for 2015-16.

The geo-spatial database on "Land Use/ Land Cover (Third Cycle) on
1:50,000 scale" is prepared using three season Resourcesat-2 ortho
rectified LISS-III data of 2015-16. Entire database are prepared by
NRSC, ISRO under Natural Resources Census (NRC) Project of National
Natural Resources Repository (NRR) Programme with the participation
of 29 State Remote Sensing Centers spread over entire country.
Interpretation of satellite imagery is done using visual interpretation
technique and individual classes were interpreted using their visual
characteristics. The LULC database is prepared with 54 class LULC
Classification Schema and are harmonized to 24 class for disseminating
through Bhuvan, ISRO Geoportal by emphasing more on Land Cover.
Output is in GIS vector file format, prepared using LCC projection and
WGS84 as datum. This will serve the requirements of academia,
researchers, planners etc.

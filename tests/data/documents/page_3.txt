NATURAL RESOURCE CENSUS LAND USE LAND COVER DATABASE FOR
DISSEMINATION THROUGH BHUVAN
INTRODUCTION
Earth observations from space platforms play a crucial role in generation and dissemination of
information on LULC pattern in a timely and reliable manner providing vital inputs required for
optimal land use planning. The evolution of Indian remote sensing program over the past two
decades, providing a variety of remote sensing- based solutions for national development, is an apt
and timely national initiative. Some of the important projects of ISRO/DOS under the theme of
LULC are given in the Table - 1.

Land Use/Land Cover Mapping on 1 : 50,000 scale
2005-06, 2011-12
A project on National Land Use/ Land Cover Mapping on 1:50,000 scale (Second Cycle) using multi-
temporal Resourcesat-2 terrain corrected Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS) -III data was
taken up by DOS, under Natural Resources Census (NRC) Project of National Natural Resources
Repository (NRR) Program. The project has been accomplished with the active participation of
various state, central, universities and others partner institutes. The land use/land cover classification
scheme of 1:50,000 scale consists of Level-I: 8 classes, Level-II: 31 classes and Level-III:
54 classes (NRSC, 2012). This classification was finalized after elaborate discussions within the DOS
and various Central/State government departments/institutions. The project had been completed
and atlas (NRSC, 2011) was released for the use of various departments central, state and others.
LULC data is regrouped for web users with an emphasis on land cover classes as given in Table - 2.
This has been undertaken keeping in view of volume of data, faster access to database and
visualization.
